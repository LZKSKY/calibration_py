# calibration_py
## The calibresult.py is a process used for calibration and Distortion of camera.
## Create a directory like "left" and put pictures inside, modify the corresponding path name and run it, you will get the intrinsic matrix from the value mtx, get the extrinsic matrix's rotation and Translation parameters each picture from rvecs and tvecs, get the distortion coefficients from dist. If you want, you can just print these.
